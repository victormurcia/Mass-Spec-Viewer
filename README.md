# Molecular Data Viewer

Streamlit App for Visualization of Molecular Data including Mass Spectra and Molecular Structures

## Overview

This Streamlit application allows users to explore and visualize different aspects of molecular data, enhancing understanding and analysis capabilities for researchers and students. The app provides interactive views of molecular structures in both 2D and 3D formats, alongside detailed mass spectra and a hierarchical classification sunburst chart for selected compounds.

## Features

- **3D Molecular Viewer**: Visualize the 3D structure of molecules using SMILES strings extracted from a dataset.
- **Molecular Structure Visualization**: Displays the 2D structure of the selected molecule.
- **Mass Spectra Viewer**: Shows the mass spectra providing insights into the compound's composition.
- **Sunburst Plot**: Displays the hierarchical classification of the compound, allowing users to understand the taxonomy and relationships of molecular components.
